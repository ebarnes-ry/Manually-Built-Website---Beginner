                                    My website is a platform for creative people in the Washington DC area to get connected to each other and in touch with things to do in the area that may be hard to find/niche otherwise. My goal with the website was to reflect this in its gallery style that draws focus to the images and what they may say, while also aesthetically mirroring the vibes of the target audience. When loading onto the website, I want its content to be driven by images and play with the association: a reader looking for a specific vibe for a dinner recommendation will look at the image of the restaurant first, connect with it, and naturally be drawn to the available content showing what we want the reader to see and associate with that first impression. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="paragraph-article">
                                    Having an idea in mind for the type of feeling I’m after in terms of aesthetics and structure and how that plays with my target audience’s presence, I gravitated to creative-based magazines alike for inspiration. Vogue does the association effect really well, playing with the structure of images and the flow of content in their directory, I implemented their methods of offsetting sidenotes and centering focus content to draw attention. This drew me to more stylistic sources of inspiration with art/culture magazines and editorials. Examples of this are Riposte and Cereal who do gallery-text interactive styling really well. I drew a lot from both in terms of structure - pulling the idea for a focal image on the home page that changes by hovering over different topics from Cereal’s home page. It does an incredibly good job of quickly expressing what each topic is about and what to expect from the section. Riposte was best at structuring stories and features in a way that was engaging and worked well as a home page. Cereals feature archive at the bottom of the home page is a genius example of separation in design- the contrast tone sets the content as being separate from everything else going on, and yet the focus on large images with captions that a reader ends up choosing to look for if interested becomes extraordinarily effective. A classic example of good design I drew on for creative inspiration and their update page structure is Eye Magazine, which maintains a magazine-like feel to its pages with everything being exactly one size not spanning the entire screen. It feels as though you’re flipping through their editorial as you navigate their website, which is a concept I really wanted to implement in my own website.

                                    Making my website accessible in a seamless way was a crucial aspect of its development. Rather than just sticking in features to check a box, accessibility in websites is on the same coin as useability or even aesthetic choices. If my website isn't accessible by nature, the final look would be severely compromised. I implemented some more back-end best practices such as using main and other semantic tags, always being detailed with my alt text in images, and structuring things in a way reachable to disability software by looking at hierarchies in the accessibility section in “inspect”. I also understand the pale gray/neutral-toned text coupled with intense at times and bold images can be a bit of a pain for anyone, and inaccessible in nature. To combat this, I developed font resizing options within article pages, bolder and magnification effects upon hovering over a subject of interest, and ***a screen filter** as the user sees any or all helpful. In making my page responsive, a user can zoom in/resize the screen as needed without things getting out of place or the structure falling apart which is a minor, yet important detail. The website layout itself is also extremely self-explanatory, with everything needed to be properly linked and traceable.

                                    To ensure my website works well with its audience, I’ve been sure to consider best practices of useability in its development. The first thing I considered was clarity in design. When a user visits my website, they probably have a goal in mind and as I developed my design, I attempted to keep those goals in mind and how I can facilitate them. For example, a lot of my users would be on there to find things to do/events to go to for planning purposes, or they might be casually browsing for general recommendations. I made sure the page directory is intuitive- when I think Art, I know to navigate to art scene recommendations. As a detail, I understand the pages given their style facilitating blown-up images, can be fatiguing to scroll through - so I added a button that takes users to the top of the page instantly. Also, recognition - the ability for users to easily “learn” my site- is also crucial to putting its ideas across and maintaining an engaging presence that doesn't overpower the goals of a user. My directory structure was intuitively designed to fit the ideal of simple navigation. Finally, relevance is a factor in the usability of my website. As a bare minimum, my website should be consistently something its users/audience is interested in. Even though there are three main categories and focus, everything holds a pretty consistent aesthetic and tasteful selection that is both familiar to users who might find this site interesting, but also just varied and curated enough to serve as a useful recommendation along the lines but not something they may already know. 
                                </p>

                                    I was not entirely used to CSS and creating responsive designs before this project. The idea of intertwining flex, media queries, and responsive grids where made sense was something that took a lot of research into documentation, studying examples, and understanding existing code to crack. Through a process of studying examples and testing with my own project, I was able to figure out the best ways to structure my website to be as flexible as possible. Another thing I struggled with initially was calling and manipulating classes and ids from javascript, and working with the type that these reference variables end up coming in when being stored in scripts. For example, I had to cast what I thought would, by nature, be an array of class references from an HTML collection to an array of values I could work with. This was one of many javascript/HTML relation bugs I had to get used to when debugging and actualizing my ideas. I also encountered type issues when I attempted to change values of font size in pixels within my javascript code - whereas I treated it as an integer I could set rather than a field of font size that had to exist in quotes as an entity. A final area I feel this project forced me to improve was my ability to move between HTML, CSS, and javascript functionalities when creating a dynamic element of my page. Switching between the three took getting used to, and a lot of work with the documentation to fully understand what I was influencing and how. 
                                </p>

                                    The specific feature I’m most proud of was the image and caption on the home page and the fully expanded menu that changes according to hovering over different menu options. It was challenging to properly pull the elements and set things without anything clashing or keeping anything local in the javascript (like simply having variables for the different caption options or image links) but actually pulling an element from one place and putting it in another as needed. I also feel that this feature adds a lot to the aesthetic of the website and I’m glad I incorporated it. A general concept I’m proud of is the way I was able to not only make a page properly respond to resizing and not get all jumbled but specifically style pages/elements differently depending on how the screen is sized - for example changing flex-direction from rows to columns, hiding elements when they can no longer fit, adapting font size, and creating responsive grids for each frame of sizing. This added to the seamlessness of my website and has quite a bit of accessible and aesthetic value. 
                                </p>

                                    I think I refined my ideas a bit more as I went along with the project, but through that, I feel I learned the importance of having a clear and set structure and concept going into things. Having that influence in the mind of everything’s purpose allows for a more cohesive and robust result in the long run which I wish I implemented in my practice sooner. Of course, I would like to connect the dots a bit more in terms of some features I implemented - a functioning search bar, functioning email input, and filling out all the links and article pages that are currently dead ends. I also for some reason decided to implement the majority of my structures in terms of lists because of the way I implemented previous projects (starting from bare html content in lists and then adding CSS after the fact), which complicated things due to the unpredictable nature of lists. This also prevented some areas for modularity and overloading in my CSS which would’ve made things a lot cleaner and more coherent to understand. I switched halfway through to a more div wrapper-based approach after being faced with debugging challenges, but I didn’t have time to migrate everything else to that format. I would have also liked to populate the page images and perhaps some of the featured articles from the topic pages themselves, but this would have required a more complicated database/data references within the code.
